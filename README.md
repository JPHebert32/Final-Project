# Final-Project

For my Finale Project, I will be using Machine Learning to predict ‘B_Yield Variance VTB’. <br />
Also, know as (vacuum bottoms yield variance) VTB is a by-product from the extraction of wax from crude oil. <br />
The only restrictions I have are I can only use only the other variables that start with Y_ as your predictors.
