# MANUFACTURING PROCESS OPTIMIZATION

### OVERVIEW<br />
The client uses a vacuum distillation process to produce the final product.<br />
A worthless byproduct is also produced through this process. I was tasked with cleaning,<br />
analyzing, and modeling datasets to find the optimal settings for the distillation<br />
process with the goal of reducing the amount of byproduct produced and increasing the amount<br />
of usable product produced.
